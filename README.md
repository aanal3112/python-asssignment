# When prompted, type your username (lowercase, no spaces), email address, and password. Don't worry that you can't see the password you're typing in â€“ that's how it's supposed to be. Type it in and press enter to continue. The output should look like this (where the username and email should be your own ones):
# Username: <USERNAME>
# Email address: <EMAIL_ID>
# Password:
# Password (again):
$ python manage.py runserver
